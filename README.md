# Plant_Leaf_Iris_Detection_using_DecisionTree
________________________________________________

Plant leaf iris detection using decision tree. 

Procedure :
=> Analyse the problem that is need to be found.
=> Collect dataset  from scikit-learn Iris Dataset. where input = 4 features.
=> Input is sepal length and width, petal length and width  and output is Iris species ( setosa, virginica, vesicolour).
=> We dont have pixel , it is dimensional value.
